# ToDoIt - the classic todo-app

This project was developed as part of my studies at Medieinstitutet to become a frontend-developer. The assignment was to create a todo-app using React and the focus was to learn and use the useState-function, props and components in React, and also to incorporate any CSS-framework which in my case was Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- **Responsive desing**: The layout is fairly simple but it adjusts to the width of the users device!
- **Keyboard Usability**: Fully accessible design allows users to interact with the application using only the keyboard.
